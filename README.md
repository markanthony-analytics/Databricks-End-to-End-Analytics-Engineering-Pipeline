## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a complete, production-style analytics pipeline that:

✔ Ingests raw parquet files into Databricks Lakehouse  
✔ Cleans & standardizes data into curated silver datasets  
✔ Produces gold-layer analytic tables for BI insights  
✔ Demonstrates incremental ingestion + Delta MERGE CDC logic  
✔ Implements testing, CI/CD, jobs automation & observability  
✔ Models real-world business metrics (LTV, revenue, product ranking)

Use-case simulated: **E-commerce analytics pipeline**.
